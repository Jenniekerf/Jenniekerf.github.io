2 months in! My brain has adjusted to a new kind of thinking and I’m slowly but surely learning about this new exciting world of coding. These last two weeks I have spent working on our first assigned project; building a CLI from scratch. It has been very challenging but also very rewarding. 

I decided to build an “Adventure Travel App” that finds adventurous trips for the adventurous mind. The website I decided to scrape my information from ended up being quite complicated and I ended up spending a lot of time trying to figure out the scraping process. Frustrating but also a good way to learn.

The trip titles were easy to scrape since they were all under a “h1” tag. It was the URL’s and the description parts that gave me trouble. They were all under the same huge tag with nothing to differentiate one part from the other. Eventually I had to iterate over the whole thing and find the pieces I needed out of almost a hundred, make a new array out of them and then use that array in the rest of my code.

The rest went pretty smoothly with help from several video tutorials and old labs from previous classes. The one thing I noticed that I kept getting stuck on was not knowing the return value of methods believing it was something different. It took me a few times getting stuck for what seemed like forever until I realized that the problem was almost always the same. It’s really hard to make an array behave the way you like it if you in fact don’t have an array etc.

On that note, Here’s a link to an info-sheet about returning values: http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_methods/return_values.html

After seeing how much I’ve actually learned this last two months I’m excited to move forward!
