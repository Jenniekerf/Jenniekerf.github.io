After over ten years of working in the restaurant industry, spending the last of those years mostly making drinks for people half my age, I finally decided that is was enough. I had just turned 40 and felt the reality of my age weighing me down both physically and mentally. I had no dreams of opening up my own restaurant, no plan for the future and no savings. 

I started to think really hard about how I wanted my life and career to look like a few years from now and what things were important to me. The things that I kept coming to back to were:

**1. Global** - I'm a world traveller. I've lived in many different countries and hope to continue to do so. Therefor I would like to learn a proffession that you can do from anywhere in the world.<br>
**2. Challenging** - I want a job that is always changing and challenging.<br>
**3. Liveable wage** - After years of living paycheck to paycheck I really want to be able to not worry about money anymore.<br>
**4. Flexibility** - I want the option to one day be able to start freelancing, so that I have the flexibility to work as much or little as I want to, during the hours I choose, from where ever I choose to reside at that moment.<br>

After having numerous talks with friends, family and random encounters I realized that the word Web Developer seemed to come up a lot. The tech world felt very far away from me but people that know me kept insisting that I should consider checking it out. 
  Eventually I gave in and took my first stumbling steps into this new, strange world and realized that I really enjoyed it. I spent a few months taking free classes online where ever I could find them and started looking into various coding bootcamps. Flatiron's part time online course is where I eventually landed and I'm now on my third week on this life changing adventure. I know it'll be challenging and many times frustrating but I can't wait to see where I'll be at one year from now!
