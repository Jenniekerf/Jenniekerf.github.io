I’ve reach the end of my Flatiron journey and it feels exciting to be done! At the same time it feels like my real journey is starting now. Looking back it really has been an intense year. Trying to manage several jobs to make enough money to pay rent and at the same time focus on learning something completely new has been tough at times. I’m definitely behind financially and I’m mentally exhausted from intense studying in between jobs. That said, I don’t regret it one bit. 

Coming from a completely different background it took me quite a while to get my brain to start thinking in a new way. It really took all I had to be able to focus and my thoughts felt like they were moving really slowly. But, after a while it got “easier”. Not so much the coding in itself cause that was pretty hard all the way through, but the way of thinking. 

I was worried at first that taking the class online wouldn’t give me enough support throughout the course but that ended up not being the case at all. The “ask a question” feature feels like it’s a 24 hour service. There was not one time that I asked a question when I didn’t get a response within a couple of minutes. Then you have your assigned cohort lead that will be by your side all the way through with weekly 1:1 meetings, live study groups and just a more personal interest in your success. On top of that I was lucky to get to know a few people in my cohort through study groups and such and we’ve been supporting and helping each other all through this last year. 

I still have a lot of things to figure out in terms of what my next step will be and definitely a lot more to learn but I feel like a have a good ground to stand on now. Only a year ago I was still working full time bartending and now I’m about to start looking for jobs in a completely new career! 

The overall feeling after this year is that Flatiron really cares about your success. Yes, it’s hard work and you really have to be prepared for that but if you put in a real effort from your side they will do the same. 

Thank you Flatiron, now I’m off to new adventures!
